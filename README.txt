The 'remainng_hours' branch attempts to revert to tracking the hours in another field than the estimated_hours. It contains a migration which brings stuff back to normal (hopefully), but the tests don't run and it has seen 0 manual testing. If you really want it back, have at it. I'll make it master as soon as you get the tests to run.

From this moment on (2011-10-15) the pace of development is going to slow down. Backlogs does what I want right now, so all of the work I've been doing the past 6 months was basically just because I enjoy Ruby and I enjoy the positive feedback. Stuff like #271 where a bug is reported, I do my best to fix it, and when I request feedback I get a "don't bother", and later comments on the same besically say "WTF are you doing?!" both show a sense of entitlement that I really don't need to be dealing with right now.

I need to focus on my family, my job, and my masters study. If this bothers you, please don't hesitate to volunteer to take over the development burden; you can reach me at friflaj@redminebacklogs.net. As soon as at least one volunteer steps forward that is effectively willing to take an equal load of this, I'll rejoin.
